# Cronjobs

## Create a cronjob

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: throw-dice-job
spec:
  completions: 3
  backoffLimit: 15 # This is so the job does not quit before it succeeds.
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: throw-dice
        image: kodekloud/throw-dice
      restartPolicy: Never
```

## That took a while. Let us try to speed it up, by running upto 3 jobs in parallel

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: throw-dice-job
spec:
  completions: 3
  parallelism: 3
  backoffLimit: 25 # This is so the job does not quit before it succeeds.
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: throw-dice
        image: kodekloud/throw-dice
      restartPolicy: Never
```

## Let us now schedule that job to run at 21:30 hours every day

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: throw-dice-cron-job
spec:
  schedule: "30 21 * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      completions: 3
      parallelism: 3
      backoffLimit: 25 # This is so the job does not quit before it succeeds.
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: throw-dice
            image: kodekloud/throw-dice
          restartPolicy: Never
```
