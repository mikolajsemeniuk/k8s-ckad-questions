# Taints and tolerations

## How many nodes exist on the system?

`kubectl get node`

## Do any taints exist on node01 node?

`kubectl describe node node01 | grep -i taints`

## Create a taint on node01 with key of spray, value of mortein and effect of NoSchedule

`kubectl taint nodes node01 spray=mortein:NoSchedule`

## Create another pod named bee with the nginx image, which has a toleration set to the taint mortein

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: bee
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: bee
  tolerations:
  - key: spray
    value: mortein
    effect: NoSchedule
    operator: Equal
```

## Remove the taint on controlplane, which currently has the taint effect of NoSchedule

`kubectl taint nodes controlplane node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule-`
