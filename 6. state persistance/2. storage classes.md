# Storage classes

## How many StorageClasses exist in the cluster right now?

`kubectl get sc`

## Let's fix that. Create a new PersistentVolumeClaim by the name of local-pvc that should bind to the volume local-pv. Inspect the pv local-pv for the specs

```yaml
---
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: local-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: local-storage
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 500Mi
```

## Create a new Storage Class called delayed-volume-sc that makes use of the below specs. provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner. volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer

```yaml
---
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: delayed-volume-sc
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```
